# project-flask-app
This is a web application that allows users to create their own projects for storing data. It is intended for storing "your favorites" lists, like your favorite books, movies, cars, etc. However, the app can also be used for other things. For example, it might help you compare different products when you are on the verge of buying something. The app also allows you to store photos and videos.  
Built for myself. No login functionality. Users can clone.
