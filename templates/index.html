            </div>
            <div class="col m6 s12">
                <p>Create a new project and determine what information you want to store on your subject. You can add <strong>text fields</strong> when your input is going to be text, for example the model of a car. Add a <strong>number field</strong> when you want to store numbers, like
                    car prices. Or a <strong>boolean field</strong> when you want to store a yes/no, for example if it is an electric car or not. You can store photos and videos later!</p>
